# Pokémon Exploratory Data Analysis

![Pokemon](pikachu.png)

Welcome to the Pokémon Exploratory Data Analysis project repository! This project is an in-depth exploration of Pokémon attributes using data analysis techniques. Through Python scripts and Jupyter Notebook, we delve into the intricate world of Pokémon, uncovering insights, correlations, and patterns within their attributes.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to answer key questions and gain insights into various aspects of Pokémon attributes:

- What is the distribution of Pokémon types based on their primary Type?
- How are different stats of Pokémon correlated with each other?
- How does the distribution of Attack stats vary among different Pokémon types?
- Are there any trends in the Average BMI across different Pokémon generations?
- What impact does Mega Evolution have on a Pokémon's Base Stat Total (BST)?
- How have the stats of Pokémon evolved across different generations?

## Repository Contents

- `script.py`: Python script containing data analysis and visualization code.
- `colors.py`: Python script defining custom colors for plots.
- `pokemon_data.csv`: Dataset containing attributes of over 1000 Pokémon species.
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete data analysis process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scipy

## Project Structure

- **Prepare Data:** Loading and cleaning the dataset.
- **Exploring Data:** Visualizations and insights about Pokémon types, correlations, and more.
